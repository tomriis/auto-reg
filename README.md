# auto-reg

Comparing the autoregistration performance of ANTS, FSL, SPM, and Freesurfer. Specifically looking at cogrestering pre operative MRI of patient brain with post operative CT scans of implanted electrodes and then warping both to common atlas space. Our objectives are to quantify variability in this process between the softwares and measure the accuracy of each.
